       <ul type ="C"><li><h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?  </h1></li>
<ul><p><li><h3>Artificial Intelligence ( AI) is a wide-ranging computer science field devoted to developing smart machines that can execute activities that usually involve human intelligence. AI is a multi-approach interdisciplinary discipline, but developments in machine learning and deep learning are causing a paradigm change across nearly every field of the software industry.</h3></li>
<br></br>
    <li><h3>Artificial Intelligence ( AI) helps robots to benefit from experience, adapt to new stimuli, and execute functions of a human existence. Most of the AI examples you hear of today – from chess machines to self-driving vehicles – depend heavily on in-depth computing and <a href ="https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-natural-language-processing-nlp.html"target="_blank">natural language processing</a>.Utilizing such techniques, machines may be taught to conduct different tasks by analyzing huge quantities of data and identifying data patterns.</h3></li>
<br><br>
<li><h3>Artificial Intelligence ( AI), the potential of a human-controlled device or automated human to execute functions typically identified with intelligent beings. The concept is also extended to the project of designing structures equipped with human characteristic mental mechanisms such as the potential to think, to explore significance, to generalize or to benefit from previous experience. Since the digital computer's invention in the 1940s it has been seen that computers can be programmed to handle very complicated tasks.</h3></li>

   <li> Artificial Intelligence is a machine, robot, or product method for thinking about how smart human thinking is. AI is a analysis of how human brain thinks, learns, determines and works as it attempts to solve problems. And finally this research produces intelligent software systems. AI's aim is to enhance functions similar to human intelligence, such as reasoning, understanding, and problem-solving. Intelligence is incorporeal. It consists of:

    <li> Logic </li>
    <li>Training to learn. 
    </li>
    <li>Solving the issue.
