        <h3><ul>
            <li>Health care: Many organizations and health-care centers depend on AI. There are other instances of how AI in healthcare has benefited patients around the world including a program to keep track on how individuals perform in nursing homes, home treatment, and so on.</li>
           <br></br> <li>Gaming: An important aspect of the entertainment business has been Artificial Intelligence. Indeed one of AI 's biggest contributions is in the game sector.</li>
           <br></br> <li> Space Exploration: The only way to manage and process data on this scale is by artificial intelligence and machine learning. Following extensive work, astronomers used Artificial Intelligence to sift data collected over years from the Kepler telescope to classify a remote eight-planet solar system.</li>
           <br></br> <li>Automated Vehicles: Designing autonomous cars would certainly revolutionize the transportation system. Tesla's self-driving car is another prominent illustration of an autonomous vehicle. Artificial Intelligence integrates artificial vision, motion recognition and deep learning to create cars that can automatically identify obstacles and move about without human interference.</li>
           <br></br> <li> Social media: AI is used for face detection in social network sites like Facebook where machine learning and deep learning techniques are used to identify facial expressions and add your friends. Machine learning algorithms are used to build the stream depending on the preferences.</li>
